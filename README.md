# 📚 Online Book Store – SQL Project


# Executive Summary

This project is an end-to-end SQL-based data analysis case study built around an Online Book Store business model.
It demonstrates my ability to design relational databases, perform data validation, write optimized SQL queries, and derive business insights.


# Business Objective

To analyze sales, customers, inventory, and revenue data of an online book store using SQL in order to:

* Understand customer purchasing behavior
* Identify best-selling books and genres
* Track revenue and high-value customers
* Monitor inventory and stock depletion

# Dataset Overview

The project uses a relational database with three interconnected tables:

Books – product and inventory data
Customers – customer demographic information
Orders – transactional sales data

This structure closely resembles real-world e-commerce databases.


# Key SQL Queries & Analysis

🔹 Basic Analysis

* Books filtered by genre and publication year
* Customers segmented by geography
* Orders analyzed by date range
* Identification of high-priced and low-stock books
* Total revenue calculation

🔹 Advanced Business Analysis

*Total books sold by genre
* Average price per genre
* Repeat customers (multiple orders)
* Most frequently ordered book
* Author-wise sales volume
* High-spending customers and their cities
* Remaining inventory after fulfilling orders.


#  Skills & Concepts Demonstrated

* Relational database design
* INNER JOIN & LEFT JOIN
* Aggregate functions: SUM, AVG, COUNT
* GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
* Date-based filtering
* Inventory and revenue analysis
* NULL handling and data consistency checks

# Business Insights (Sample)

* Identified top-selling genres contributing the highest sales volume
* Detected high-value customers based on total spending
* Highlighted books with low remaining stock for inventory planning
